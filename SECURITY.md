# Security & Intellectual Property Protection

## Overview

This document outlines security measures implemented to protect IntegridAI's intellectual property, particularly the MAHOUT™ technology.

## Protection Layers

### 1. Code Separation
- **Public Repository**: Contains ONLY interfaces and integration code
- **Private Systems**: MAHOUT™ algorithms hosted on secure servers
- **API Gateway**: All MAHOUT™ access goes through authenticated API

### 2. Legal Protection
- **Patents**: Patent application filed (pending)
- **Trade Secrets**: Core algorithms never exposed
- **Trademarks**: MAHOUT™ is a registered trademark
- **Licenses**: Commercial license required for production use

### 3. Technical Protection
- **Obfuscation**: Production API responses are minimized
- **Encryption**: All API communications use TLS 1.3
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents reverse engineering attempts
- **Watermarking**: Hidden identifiers in API responses

### 4. Monitoring & Enforcement
- **Usage Analytics**: All API calls logged and analyzed
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual patterns trigger alerts
- **Legal Team**: Active monitoring for violations
- **DMCA**: Prepared to issue takedowns for violations

## What Developers Can Access

### With Demo License (Free)
- Basic interface to MAHOUT™ API
- Limited request volume (1000/month)
- Basic scoring only
- No SLA guarantees

### With Commercial License
- Full MAHOUT™ API access
- Production-grade scoring
- SLA guarantees
- Technical support
- Custom integration assistance

## Security Best Practices

### For IntegridAI
1. Never commit proprietary code to public repos
2. Use environment variables for all secrets
3. Implement API key rotation every 90 days
4. Monitor all repositories for accidental exposures
5. Maintain separate development/production environments

### For Users
1. Never share your API keys
2. Use environment variables, not hardcoded values
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Respect rate limits
5. Report any security issues to security@integridai.com

## Incident Response

If proprietary code is accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediate**: Remove from all public locations
2. **Within 1 hour**: Rotate all potentially affected credentials
3. **Within 24 hours**: Legal notice to any who accessed
4. **Within 48 hours**: Full security audit
5. **Ongoing**: Monitor for unauthorized use

## Compliance

This system complies with:
- GDPR (data protection)
- CCPA (California privacy)
- SOC 2 Type II (security)
- ISO 27001 (information security)
